**Assignment**

- Repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to get_next_line() function should let read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
- Function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
- Make sure that your function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input.

**Result: :one::two::five: / :one::zero::zero: :heavy_check_mark:**
